      #         Reagan’s tax cuts. The national debt doubled in size. When the Clinton tax hikes were proposed in 1993, Republicans predicted a recession. When the tax cuts were enacted, they were proven wrong. Similarly, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 were based on this principle, but blew another hole in the deficit. This experiment in supply-side economics has been carried out at the state level as well, with Republicans making the same claims, in Wisconsin, Kansas, West Virginia. All resulted in the same: sluggish economic growth and massive budget shortfalls. This was again supported by the Trump tax cuts. Massive corporate tax cuts, justified on the grounds that… would boost wages, cut prices to benefit consumers, or invest the money in new technology or training for their workers. Instead, just as the left predicted, corporations used the money to buy back their own shares, restricting the supply and boosting the value of the shares that remained in the hands of the shareholders who didn’t sell. Investment has continued to fall.

              The amount of money we spend on fighting poverty is irrelevant, because capitalism creates poverty <a href="/are-social-welfare-programs-doomed-to-fail/">on an ongoing basis</a>.

Social welfare programs in fact reduce this rate of poverty from around 26 percent to 16 percent in the US, and have all but eliminated poverty in many other developed countries.

When individual families all ‘tighten their belts’ at the same time, this deepens a recession, because demand for goods and services drops in the aggregate, depriving some of income they would recieve if the economy were operating at full output. While it might seem rational for individual families to cut back on spending, since they may be unsure their income is secure, this is not true of the government, which can undergo fiscal expansion during a recession in order to prop up aggregate demand until expected levels of spending and income realign with society’s productive capacity.

              When the Right refers to the fruits of one’s labor, they mean one’s <em>market income</em>. This begs the question, since whether everyone should be entitled to keep all of their market income is what’s at issue. One reason why is that market income <a href="/should-individuals-be-entitled-to-the-fruits-of-their-labor/">isn’t the same as the fruits of one’s labor</a>. Most of it comes from the society in which one happens to live.

  #             Eberstadt’s numbers are irrelevant. They measure the absolute amount of spending on social welfare programs while ignoring population growth (more people, more spending) and the growth of the economy (more money, the greater ability to support a larger population), and don’t take into account inflation, nor the fact that most of this increase in spending per person is due to rising healthcare costs rather than new benefits, which is due to private healthcare providers, not the something inherent in government spending (evidenced by every other country where the government plays a larger role in its healthcare system).

              Friedman assumes economic exchange that supposedly meets his criteria (voluntary, mutually beneficial, without coercion) is just. This begs the question, since whether these forms of economic exchange are just is what’s at issue. This is because exchange that Friedman would consider voluntary <a href="/does-the-right-favor-free-markets">is often anything but</a>, the fact that an exchange is mutually beneficial hardly justifies the exchange, and coercion is not inherently unjust (coercion might be justified in order to counter forms of market coercion that arise from so-called voluntary or mutually beneficial exchange).

              The Right claims that taxation violates property rights. But to the Right, property rights means “property I believe I’m entitled to keep.” This begs the question, since whether you should be entitled to keep the property in question is what’s at issue. This is because the way we distribute property before taxes (via the market) <a href="/do-conservatives-oppose-taxation-in-order-to-protect-property-rights/">comes at the expense of individual liberty</a>.

              When the Right claims that “property rights” are necessary for individual liberty, they’re referring to legal institutions societies establish to allow individuals to be secure in their property. But when the Right claims taxation violates their property rights, they’re referring to <em>moral</em> claims they believe entitle them to keep certain property, regardless of <a href="/do-conservatives-oppose-taxation-in-order-to-protect-property-rights">whether or not they’re legally entitled to it</a>.

But the issue is how best to preserve the civil society in a world of imperfect people and institutions. The answer, the Framers concluded, is to diversify authority with a combination of governing checks, balances, and divisions, intended to prevent the concentration of unbridled power in the hands of a relative few imperfect people."

A republic and a democracy, however, <a href="/isn-t-the-us-a-republic-not-a-democracy">aren’t mutually exclusive concepts</a>. A republic can lean democratic, or lean towards aristocracy.

      - quote: "Equality, as understood by the American Founders, is the natural right of every individual to live freely under self-government, to acquire and retain the property he creates through his own labor, and to be treated impartially before a just law. Moreover, equality should not be confused with perfection, for man is also imperfect, making his application of equality, even in the most just society, imperfect. Otherwise, inequality is the natural state of man in the sense that each individual is born unique in all his human characteristics. Therefore, equality and inequality, properly comprehended, are both engines of liberty."

              Romney is trying to show that the US tax system is unfair, because the affluent pay federal income taxes, whereas lower-income Americans don’t. Citing the percentage of Americans who pay no federal income tax is irrelevant to whether or not the US tax system is fair, however, since it ignores other taxes (local, state, payroll, and consumption taxes) that disproportionately burden those with less income, as well as the fact that other forms of income the affluent receive (employer benefits, investment income, inheritance) are taxed at lower rates. When accounting for these factors, America’s tax system is <a href="https://taxjusticenow.org/">only slightly progressive</a>. Romney also ignores the benefits the affluent recieve from what tax dollars pay for, which <a href="/do-rich-people-bear-the-greatest-tax-burden">far outweigh the benefits the rest of society receives</a>.

              Libertarians assume violence is always wrong. This begs the question, because whether violence is always wrong is what’s at issue. Indeed, enforcing property rights&mdash;something the Right has no problem with&mdash;involves the threat of violence, and libertarians have no problem with it. Libertarians try to get around this problem by redefining violence to exclude the enforcement of property rights. Note that Rothbard defines violence as something done against one’s person <em>or property</em>. This still begs the question, however, because whether or not it’s okay to use violence to redistribute property then becomes what’s at issue. There are <a href="/do-conservatives-oppose-taxation-in-order-to-protect-property-rights/">all sorts of reasons</a> why we should have no problem committing violence in this case.

              In the first sense Shaprio uses the term “racist,” he’s arguing against the existence of institutional racism, in other words <a href="/does-institutional-racism-exist/">the persistence of racial disparities</a> (in income, wealth, housing, education, the criminal justice system, and so on) due to past institutions such as slavery and Jim Crow, along with implicit bias among those who hold powerful positions in society (judges, prosecutors, the police, politicians, and so on). But in the second sense, Shapiro uses the word “racism” to refer overtly racist attitudes among people living today.

              The Right uses this fact to argue against antipoverty programs. The fact that we’ve spent $22 trillion to fight poverty, yet still have poverty, is irrelevant, because capitalism <a href="/are-social-welfare-programs-doomed-to-fail">creates poverty on an ongoing basis</a>. The relevant metric should be how much antipoverty programs have reduced poverty relative to what the poverty rate would be in their absence.

It was liberal Democrats who pushed for these laws, and Democrats even had to water down the Civil Rights Act to gain Republican support.

And it’s also why the remorseless shriveling of the tax rolls is a cancer at the heart of republican citizenship."

The conservative ascendency of 1964 saw the nomination of Barry Goldwater, a western libertarian who had never been strongly identified with racial issues one way or the other, but who was a principled critic of the 1964 act and its extension of federal power."
